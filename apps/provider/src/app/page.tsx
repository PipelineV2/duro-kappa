            <div className="mb-5">
              when you sign up on duro, you can create queues which each will have qr codes attached to them. <br />
              these qr codes (and/or) the queue's unique url can be displayed in various places. (literally, anywhere you want.)
            </div>
            <div className="w-[4rem] my-6 border-b-2 border-gray-800 mx-auto"> </div>
            <div className="mb-5">
              your customers can then scan these qr codes or enter the unique link in their browsers and join your queue from there. <br />
              you can advance the queue and dismiss users as the queue progresses easily through the admin dashboard. <br />
            </div>
            <div className="w-[4rem] my-6 border-b-2 border-gray-800 mx-auto"> </div>
            <div className="mb-5">
              the admin dashboard also allows you to add more branches as your business expands. and each business will have its own admin and queues.
